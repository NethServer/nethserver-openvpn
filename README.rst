==================
nethserver-openvpn
==================

Supported VPN are:

* Client to server (roadwarrior)
* Network to network (net2net)


Events
======

* ``openvpn-tunnel-create``: fired when a new tunnel is created, takes the tunnel name as argument
* ``openvpn-tunnel-delete``: fired when a new tunnel is deleted, takes the tunnel name as argument
* ``openvpn-tunnel-modify``: fired when a new tunnel is modified, takes the tunnel name as argument
* ``nethserver-vpn-save``: fired when roadwarrior account or server is changed
* ``openvpn-tunnel-upload``: used to transform a given file to a read-to-use tunnel client


Roadwarrior accounts
====================

Accounts are used to identify clients connecting to the server itself. There are two types of account:

* user account: system user with VPN access using user name and password
* vpn-only account: simple account with only VPN access

Each account can be used in a roadwarrior connection (host to net). 
If a net to net tunnel is needed, ``VPNRemoteNetwork`` and ``VPNRemoteNetmask`` 
properties must be set to inform the server about remote routes.
When a new account is created, a certificate with same name is generated inside ``/var/lib/nethserver/certs`` directory.

Properties:

* ``VPNRemoteNetwork``: remote network
* ``VPNRemoteNetmask``: remote netmask
* ``OpenVpnIp``: reserved IP for the client

Roadwarrior server
==================

Certificates
------------

All certificates are signed using NethServer default RSA key (``/etc/pki/tls/private/NSRV.key``).

CA environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CA configuration is stored inside ``/var/lib/nethserver/`` directory, all certificates are stored inside ``/var/lib/nethserver/certs``. The ``nethserver-openvpn-conf`` action creates:

* ``serial``, ``certindex.attr`` and ``/certindex``: database of valid and revoked certificates
* ``crlnumber`` and ``/etc/openvpn/certs/crl.pem``: certificate revocation list
* ``dh1024.pem``: key for TLS negotation


Certificate creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certificates in PEM format can be created using the command: ::

  /usr/libexec/nethserver/pki-vpn-gencert <commonName>

The ``commonName`` parameter is an unique name stored inside the certificate. 
The command will generate ``key``, ``crt`` and ``csr`` file.
Each generated certificate is referred with a numeric id and saved inside ``certindex`` database. OpenSSL will also create a certificated called as with the generated id (eg. ``02.pem``). 

Certificate revocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certificate revocation is done via the command: ::

    /usr/libexec/nethserver/pki-vpn-revoke [-d] <commonName>

The ``commonName`` parameter is an unique name stored inside the certificate. 
If '-d' option is enabled, also delete ``crt``, ``csr``, ``pem`` and key files

Certificate renewal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All certificates will expire after ``X`` days, where ``X`` is the value of ``CertificateDuration`` property inside ``pki`` key.
Renew is done via the command: ::

  /usr/libexec/nethserver/pki-vpn-renew <commonName>

The ``commonName`` parameter is an unique name stored inside the certificate. 


Client configuration is generated using ``/usr/libexec/nethserver/openvpn-local-client`` command. 
The file will contain the CA certificate inside the <ca>.

Example: ::

  /usr/libexec/nethserver/openvpn-local-client myuser

The OpenVPN server listens on a management socket: ``/var/spool/openvpn/host-to-net``.
It's possible to retrieve server status and execute commands using the socket.

Available scripts:

* ``/usr/libexec/nethserver/openvpn-status``: retrieve status of connected clients and return result in JSON format
* ``/usr/libexec/nethserver/openvpn-kill``: kill a connected client, exits 0 on success, 1 otherwise

Example with netcat: ::

  >INFO:OpenVPN Management Interface Version 1 -- type 'help' for more info
  status
  OpenVPN CLIENT LIST
  Updated,Thu Jan 23 09:22:24 2014

Tunnel topology
===============

Available topology are ``subnet`` and ``p2p``

If topology is ``p2p``:

- only ``psk`` authentication mode is available
- options ``LocalPeerIP`` and ``RemotePeerIP`` must be set for both server and client
- options ``RemoteNetworks`` must be set if the client should be able to reach
  networks behind the tunnel server

If topology is ``subnet``:

- only ``password``, ``certificate`` or ``password-certificate`` authentication mode are available
- options ``Network`` must be set for the server

Tunnel clients
==============

OpenVPN clients are used to connect to a tunnel server obtaining a net2net VPN.

Common properties:

* ``AuthMode``: default value is ``certificate``. Possible values:

  * ``certificate``: use x509 certificate. Certificates, including CA and private key, are saved in ``/var/lib/nethserver/certs/clients`` directory in a PEM file named ``key``.pem

  * ``password-certificate``: use user name, password and a valid x509 certificate
  * ``psk``: use a pre-shared key
* ``Cipher``: a valid OpenVPN cipher among ``openvpn --show-ciphers``
* ``Compression``: can be ``enabled``, ``disabled`` or a valid compression alghoritm (see `man openvpn`). If set to `enabled`, adaptive LZO compression is used
* ``LocalPeerIP`` and ``RemotePeerIP``: IP for the Point to Point hosts

* ``Protocol``: can be ``udp`` or ``tcp``, default is ``udp``
* ``RemoteHost``: a list of remote server hostnames or ip addresses
* ``RemoteNetworks``: list of networks in CIDR format, for each network will be created a route
* ``RemotePort``: remote host port
* ``User``: username used for authentication, if ``AuthMode`` is ``password`` or ``password-certificate``
* ``WanPriorities``: an ordered list of red interfaces which will be used to connect to the server, can be
  used to prefer a faster WAN other than a slower one

Tunnel servers
==============

Servers are instance of OpenVPN listening for incoming connections.
Each server runs on its own port can handle many client.

When a server is created the following files will be generated:

- a certificate and a private key: ``/var/lib/nethserver/openvpn-tunnels/<name>.crt`` and ``/var/lib/nethserver/openvpn-tunnels/keys/<name>.key``
- a pre-shared key ``/var/lib/nethserver/openvpn-tunnels/<name>.key``

Certificate generation uses a custom version of easy-rsa, see ``/usr/share/nethserver-openvpn`` directory content.

Properties:
* ``Cipher``: a valid OpenVPN cipher among ``openvpn --show-ciphers``
* ``Compression``: can be ``enabled``, ``disabled`` or a valid compression alghoritm (see `man openvpn`). If set to `enabled`, adaptive LZO compression is used
* ``LocalNetworks``: list of networks in CIDR format, each network will be pushed as route to the client
* ``LocalPeerIP`` and ``RemotePeerIP``: IP for the Point to Point hosts
* ``Network``: network address of the VPN tunnel
* ``Port``: listen port
* ``Protocol``: can be ``udp`` or ``tcp``, default is ``udp``
* ``PublicAddresses``: list of public IPs or host names used by clients to connect to the server
* ``RemoteNetworks``: list of networks in CIDR format, for each network will be created a local route
* ``Topology``: can be ``subnet`` (default) or ``p2p``
* ``status``: enable or disabled the OpenVPN server, can be ``enabled`` or ``disabled``, default is ``disabled``

Templates
=========

The main templates for the configuration are:

- ``/etc/e-smith/templates/etc/openvpn/host-to-net.conf``: allows the customization of roadwarrior server
- ``/etc/e-smith/templates/openvpn-tunnel-server/``: allows the customization of tunnel server, it's expanded
  in ``/etc/openvpn/<tunnel_server_name>.conf``
- ``/etc/e-smith/templates/openvpn-tunnel-client/``: allows the customization of tunnel client, it's expanded
  in ``/etc/openvpn/<tunnel_client_name>.conf``

Log files and systemd instances
===============================

All OpenVPN services are handled using systemd instances of the ``openvpn`` service.

Every instance has the following form: ``openvpn@<instance_name>`` where
``instance_name`` is name of the key inside the ``vpn`` e-smith db.
The roadwarrior server has a fixed name: ``host-to-net``.

Instances can be inspected using ``systemctl`` command: ::

   systemctl status openvpn@host-to-net
   systemctl status openvpn@server1


The roadwarrior can be found here:

- ``/var/log/openvpn/host-to-net-status.log``
- ``/var/log/openvpn/openvpn.log``


The log if each OpenVPN instance can be seen using ``journalctl`` command.
Example: ::

  journalctl -u openvpn@client1
  journalctl -u openvpn@host-to-net
