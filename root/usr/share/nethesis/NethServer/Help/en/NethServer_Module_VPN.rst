When creating a net2net tunnel, you should choose one of the server as master.
The master must have the roadwarrior server enabled.
The slave must be configured using the :guilabel:`Client` tab.

Enable roadwarrior server
    Enable roadwarrior OpenVPN server listening on default UDP port 1194.
    The server will handle multiple client connections.

Authentication mode
    Select the desired authentication method.
    Three methods are available:

    * Username and password: choose it when you want to use a system user
    * Certificate: choose when creating a net2net configuration
    * User, password and certificate: this is the most secure combination.
      The user must be a system user.

    * Netmask: VPN network mask. Eg: 255.255.255.0

Bridged mode
    Must be used if the VPN must carry IP and non-IP (eg. NetBios) traffic.
    When this mode is selected, VPN clients will have an IP from the LAN network segment.

    The OpenVPN server will reply to remote DHCP.
    If a DHCP server is already present inside the LAN, make sure to
    choose a free range which will not collide with current DHCP server configuration.

    * Bridge: associated bridge interface
    * IP range start: first IP address of the range
    * IP range stop: last IP address of the range
